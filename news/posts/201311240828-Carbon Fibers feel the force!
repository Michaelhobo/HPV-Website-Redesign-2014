<p>To build the frame and drive shaft for this year's human powered vehicle, we're testing out a new process for creating carbon fiber layups. Using high grade aerospace carbon fibers with almost 10x the strength of steel and our specialized layups, a 100g part took 1125 lbs of force! The over half ton of force didn't do as much as you might expect, and it did not fail structurally even after the fibers broke. You'll see in the graph below that it can take the load continuously, despite large amounts of deformation and cracking.</p>
