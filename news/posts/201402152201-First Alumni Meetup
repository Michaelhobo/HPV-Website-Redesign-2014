On Feb 15th, HPV hosted its first ever alumni meetup. 4 members from teams ranging from 89-94 came to talk about their experiences, give advice to the current team, and talk about where HPV has brought them. The current team gave a presentation regarding the new team's history and current prospects. Some of the alumni brought pictures of their years with the team. A solid half an hour was spent figuring out how to get a slide projector to work; all the members on the new team are too young to know how to function one! The team learned a lot of useful information for Reuben and made some good connections. Overall, the event was a success. Time to get back work on Reuben!
