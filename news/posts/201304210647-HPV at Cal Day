<p>The Human Powered Vehicle at Berkeley team showed off its newest vehicle, PB&amp;J, as well as its shiny 2nd place trophy, to prospective students and interested community members at Cal Day today. On a beautifully sunny Saturday, HPV team members talked about the team's recent accomplishments at the ASME HPVC, displayed molds and parts that were used to create the bike, and answered any questions visitors had about Berkeley in general. It was great to meet potential Berkeley engineers and show off everything our team has to offer to the engineering community.</p>

<p>Thanks to everyone who stopped by our table today and talked to us. Hopefully we see you around campus next semester, and we hope you consider joining the HPV team!</p>
