<p>Looks like HPV members are almost as good at winning scavenger hunts as they are at building bikes. The team held a scavenger hunt with free pizza and cookies. The clever clues took three teams of five all over the Berkeley campus. Only with ingenuity and a handy dandy smart phone were the teams able to complete the challenge. The winning team (Soroush Motahari, Zane Liu, and Mike Ambrose) scored 22 points out of 35.</p>
