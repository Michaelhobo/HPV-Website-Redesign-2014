<p>Our old friend, PB&amp;J, got a shiny, brand new chain ring this thanks to HPV member, Andrew Taylor. He helped to design and CNC a 70 teeth chain ring that was fit on to the bike to replace the standard 53 tooth one. Andrew is happy to report that PB&amp;J is very excited to get the new chain ring. The new, shiner, much larger chain ring will increase the top speed of the bike to an estimated 42mph.</p>
<p>Senior members have already pushed the bike up to 32mph so far with several gears left. They report that the bike feels much smoother in the low gears with the large chainring. The team is currently looking for a long enough straight to get PB&amp;J up to speed!</p>
