<p>Fall 2013 is just getting started and the Human Powered Vehicle team is getting revved up for another awesome semester.</p>
<p>If you haven't already heard about us, we're a fun-loving, engineering student group that applies theory to practice by building aerodynamic recumbent bicycles. We compete in the ASME Human Powered Vehicle Competition every year against other student groups. It's an awesome way to start applying your engineering knowledge to a real-life project, becoming part of the Berkeley engineering community, and meeting industry professionals.</p>
<p>At last year's ASME competition, we took second place in the endurance race. This year we're looking to take it up one notch higher and secure a first place. Become a part of a great group that knows how to work hard and have fun!</p>
