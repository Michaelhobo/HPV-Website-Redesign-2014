<p>The Richmond Field Station is a mysterious place. It is at once simple in its collection of tan portables along with scattered gray warehouses, and complicated in the variety of labs it hosts and the peculiar wildlife that seems to reside there. Turkeys have been known to frolic in the reeds by the roadside. On Sunday, one of our members was even graced with the appearance of a small red fox, leaping through the rain.</p>
<p>This was the course most of the day took on our inaugural trip out to the station with the new club members. Surprises and small delights were the theme of the day. The morning saw buckets of pouring rain and a short tour as everyone stood in a dripping circle to examine the treasures of the lab. Soon after, the new members had a chance to get their hands dirty, doing some practice layups with last year's lug molds and becoming familiar with the stickiness of resin and its dangers to nice clothes. One group got creative with the vacuum pump, using it to weigh down their lug pieces, as they were shortchanged on weights.</p>
<p>The senior members also unleashed their ingenuity to find a way of barbecuing in the rain (by borrowing a canopy tent from CalSol). Onion and tomatoes were cut with plastic knives and scissor blades. Quinoa was eaten in cups. Co-team lead, Harlan, cooked up some excellent burgers, despite a good portion of grilled onions ending up in the coals. See below for a sampling of awesome day the team had out at the station!</p>
<h4>Quick shout out to all of those who came out to check out the Human Powered Vehicle lab at the Richmond Field Station. Special thanks to Sam, Soroush, and Harlan for driving people. There will be more awesome trips to come!</h4><br>
<p>Stay tuned for more info on this week's crash course, Wednesday 9/25 from 7 to 8pm!</p>
