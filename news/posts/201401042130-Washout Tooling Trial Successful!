<p>Over a month ago we posted pictures of a washout tooling mold on our Facebook page. Before finals, HPV members finally got around to using it with our Aquapour washout tooling solution. After pouring the solution into the mold, it was left to set overnight, pulled out, and cured in the oven.</p>

<p>Members then layed up the tooling with carbon fiber scraps. The part may not be pretty because of the use of scraps, but ultimately proved what we were setting out to test: the tooling washed out and held up under vacuum bag pressures. We are excited and relieved that this test worked as it will greatly aid us in developing tooling for our frame.</p>
