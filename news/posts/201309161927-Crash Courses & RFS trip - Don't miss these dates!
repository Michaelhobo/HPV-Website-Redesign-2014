<p>All crash courses will feature presentations from the senior members of the team and will be located in Etcheverry. We'll be meeting just inside the doors of Etcheverry. Come prepared to learn more than you'll ever have thought possible about bike building and engineering!</p>

<p>Etcheverry Hall is located on the Northside of campus, right next to Soda. Check <a href="http://www.berkeley.edu/map/3dmap/3dmap.shtml">here</a> for a map to the building.</p>
<p>The easiest way to enter is from the third or second floor entrances. Team members will be standing outside each entrance wearing bright blue t-shirts and will to direct you to the room. Etcheverry may be locked, so these members will card key you into the building if needed.</p>
