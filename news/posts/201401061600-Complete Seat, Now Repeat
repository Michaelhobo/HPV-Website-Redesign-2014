<p>The first Seat layup test for the new bike has been completed! We've been able to try many new processes we've never done before. Expanding foam has proven to be a solid choice for building molds, but temperature and pressures associated with laminates could prove problematic. The seat layup has also proven to be a very complex layup despite its looks. Achieving a structurally sound layup while also looking presentable has been an interesting challenge! Â The team is learning quickly, and hopefully a lot of the lessons learned will help immensely for our first fairing!</p>
