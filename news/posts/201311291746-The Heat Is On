<p>Team members have been working all semester to design a vacuum forming table for making plastic parts. The vacuum table could be a great asset for making quick molds or shells of parts that we want to build for the bike. A few problems with material acquisition have caused members to think creatively and redesign the table out of wood instead of aluminum. After an afternoon of work the table has been pieced together and is perfectly level. The light sockets have been soldered together and the heat lamps are up and running! Next up is building the vacuum table for the molds.</p>
