<p>The Human Powered Vehicle Team at Berkeley is coming to Cal Day this Saturday, 4/20! Team members will be in the Etcheverry breezeway from 10am-3pm, showing off our newest bike, PB&amp;J, as well as other bike parts and photos from our most recent competition. Come by if you are a prospective freshman, current student, or anyone interested in what the mechanical engineering community has to offer. Hope to see you all there!</p>
