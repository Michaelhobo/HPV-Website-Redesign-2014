<p>Reuben is designed with a unique drive shaft drivetrain. It will become one of the few bikes ever built with carbon fiber drive shafts. Due to Reuben's low profile, the design necessitates gears and Ujoints to put the shafts through the curves of the frame. The team has no experience with these components and there is little data for the load ranges Reuben is expected to see, so the team set out to test the parts.</p>

<p>After a long week of machining, the team finished the over-built test fixture. The shafts are made out of aluminum bar stock to take the carbon fiber shafts out of the question for strength; those shafts will be tested separately. The team was only able to test the U-Joints. The U-Joints were put through a full range of articulation to verify their angles in the bike design. To the team's relief, the U-Joint operated smoothly over the entire range of travel specified by the manufacturer and thus should work in the design well.</p>

<p>The team is currently working on resetting this setup to work with the gears specified for Reuben's drive train. It will be a little while before they can test, but measuring the resistance from the bevel gears is important for the drivetrain efficiency.</p>
