!Welcome to the Human Powered Vehicle Wiki!

We're a team of engineers striving to push the boundaries of human powered vehicles and our own abilities as engineers by working on this engineering project.

Our team rallies around the idea of learning outside the classroom, so a vital function of the team is to pass on knowledge from one generation of engineers to the next. Hence, this wiki is important to continue and grow the team year after year. This is UC Berkeley Human Powered Vehicle Team's knowledge base, and will hopefully always be a work in progress!

Here is a quick reference to each year's bike:
