<p>HPV would like to extend our deepest thanks to Tencate for donating carbon fibers to the team. The team uses carbon fiber extensively to make the lightest, strongest, and most complex bikes possible. Tencate offers the absolute best in composite materials used in the aerospace industry. Tencate offers precise, consistent, and reliable fibers. This allows engineers to achieve what would be impossible with any other material, even other carbon fibers.</p>
